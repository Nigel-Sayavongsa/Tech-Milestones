            <h2>Beginning</h2>
                <h3>Release Date: December 13, 2016</h3>
                    <p>AirPods are wireless Bluetooth earbuds created by Apple. They were first released on December 13, 2016 and are sold alongside the premium AirPods Pro.
                        <p>The seamless pairing between the AirPods and Apple’s devices is made possible with the new Apple W1 chip. Apple’s W1 chip produces efficient wireless for a better connection, improved sound and manages battery life. While pairing AirPods with your Apple device is rather simple, there are a number of other subtle features that make the AirPods even more useful. Here are 11 AirPods tips and tricks you should also know about:Apple in March 2019 overhauled the AirPods and introduced the first ever update with a handful of useful new features that make the Apple-designed earbuds better than ever. AirPods now support hands-free "Hey Siri" functionality, allowing users to control volume and swap songs through voice commands, so there's no longer a need to tap on the AirPods with a finger to activate Siri in this version.</p>
                    In addition to playing audio, AirPods feature a built-in microphone that filters out background noise, which allows taking phone calls and talking to Apple's digital assistant, Siri. Additionally, built-in accelerometers and optical sensors can detect taps (e.g. double-tap to pause audio) and in-ear placement, which enables automatic pausing when they are taken out of the ears.</p>

                <h2>1st Generation</h2>
                    <h3>September 7, 2016 </h3>
                        <p>AirPods were announced on September 7, 2016 at an Apple Special Event alongside the iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2. Apple originally planned to release them in late October, but delayed the release date. On December 13, 2016, Apple began taking orders online. They were available at Apple Stores, Apple Authorized Resellers, and select carriers on December 20.</p>
                            <p>AirPods contain a proprietary Apple W1 SoC which helps optimize battery use and processes the Bluetooth 4.2 connection as well as audio. The additional connectivity functions of the W1 requires devices running iOS 10, macOS Sierra, watchOS 3, or later. They can also function as standard Bluetooth headphones when connected to any device that supports Bluetooth 4.0 or higher, including Windows laptops Android devices. There are two microphones in each AirPod, one at ear level, facing outward, and another at the bottom of the stem.</p>
                                <p>Each AirPod weighs 0.14 oz (4 g), and its charging case weighs 1.34 oz (38 g). AirPods holds a charge of around five hours, while charging them for fifteen minutes in the case gives three hours of listening time. The charging case provides 24 hours of total usage. During a teardown, each AirPod was found to contain a 93 milliwatt hour battery in its stem, while the charging case contains a 1.52 watt hour or 398 mAh at 3.81 V battery.

                                They were discontinued on March 20, 2019 after the second generation was released.</p>
                <h2>2nd Generation</h2>
                    <h3>March 20, 2019</h3>
                        <p>Apple announced 2nd generation AirPods on March 20, 2019. They include an H1 processor which supports hands-free "Hey Siri", Bluetooth 5 connectivity, and Apple claims 50% more talk time and faster device connection times. “Announce Messages with Siri” was added in iOS 13.2, which allows Siri to dictate and reply to text messages.</p>
                            <p>2nd generation AirPods can be purchased with the same charging case as the 1st generation, or for an additional $40 bundled with the Wireless Charging Case, which can be used with Qi chargers. The Wireless Charging Case can be purchased separately for $79 and is compatible with 1st generation AirPods. It moves the charging indicator LED to the exterior of the case. The Wireless Charging Case was initially announced in September 2017 alongside the AirPower charging mat, but was delayed by AirPower's protracted development and eventual cancellation.</p>
                                <p>AirPods deliver an industry-leading6 5 hours of listening time7 — and now up to 3 hours of talk time8 — all on one charge.

                <h2>Airpod's Pro</h2>
                    <h3>October 30, 2019</h3>
                        <p>AirPods pro are compatible with any device that supports Bluetooth 4.0 or higher, including Android devices, although certain features such as automatic switching between devices are only available on Apple devices using iCloud. AirPods have full functionality with the following devices</p>
                            <p>Testing conducted by Apple in October 2019 using preproduction AirPods Pro with Wireless Charging Case and software paired with iPhone 11 Pro Max units and prerelease software. The playlist consisted of 358 unique audio tracks purchased from the iTunes Store (256-Kbps AAC encoding). Volume was set to 50% and Active Noise Cancellation was enabled. Testing consisted of full AirPods Pro battery discharge while playing audio until the first AirPod Pro stopped playback. The drained AirPods Pro were charged to 100 percent, then audio playback was resumed until the first AirPod Pro stopped playback. This cycle was repeated until both the AirPods Pro and charging case were fully discharged. Battery life depends on device settings, environment, usage, and many other factors.</p>
                                <p>2nd generation AirPods are compatible with devices running iOS 12.2 or later, macOS Mojave 10.14.4 or later, and watchOS 5.2 or later.Testing conducted by Apple in October 2019 using preproduction AirPods Pro with Wireless Charging Case and software paired with iPhone 11 Pro Max units and prerelease software.

                <h2>Firmware</h2>
                    <h3>February 2017</h3>
                        <p>Apple has a program to service batteries and purchase replacement individual AirPods and charging cases.</p>
                            <p>AirPods contain upgradeable firmware. Its original firmware was 3.3.1. In February 2017, Apple released 3.5.1,3.7.2 in May 2017, and then 6.3.2 on March 26, 2019. In July 2019, 6.7.8 was released and 6.8.8 followed in September 2019. The latest firmware is 1A691. AirPods automatically sync through Apple's iCloud service, allowing users to switch audio sources to other supported devices connected by the same Apple ID.AirPods come with the AirPods Charging Case, which is used for both charging and storage purposes so the AirPods don't get lost. The Charging Case is about the size of a container of dental floss, so it's easily pocketable. A Lightning port at the bottom lets the AirPods and the case be charged with the Lightning cables you already have on hand, and the Wireless Charging Case lets you charge with a Qi wireless charger.</p>
                                <p>The second-generation AirPods, or AirPods 2, have an updated H1 chip instead of a W1 chip. The H1 allows the AirPods to switch between your devices twice as fast, and connecting a phone call is 1.5x faster. The new AirPods have the same general battery life, but three hours of talk time instead of two. You won't see any design differences between AirPods 1 and AirPods 2 because they're identical.AirPods come with the AirPods Charging Case, which is used for both charging and storage purposes so the AirPods don't get lost.

                <h2>Reception and Criticism</h2>
                    <p>On announcement day, AirPods were compared to Apple's previously existing EarPods (2012–present), with The Verge noting "They look... just like the old EarPods, with the wires cut off."Initially mocked by many for its unfamiliar design (including CNN asking "Would people actually wear these?" in 2016), its popularity grew rapidly over the years and was voted the most popular "hearable" brand of 2019.In this area, you will also notice an automatic ear detection toggle. This feature automatically transfers the audio route from connected devices to the AirPods when they are placed in your ears. When you toggle it off, you will have to manually connect to the AirPods.</p>
                        <p>One criticism of AirPods is their high price (about $150); however, at launch they were actually priced less than most "true wireless" earbuds on the market (e.g. the Samsung Gear IconX and Bragi Dash) and remain competitively priced with similar products from other major brands. Another criticism is the perceived tendency to fall out of one's ear; however, testing by Business Insider has shown that it is quite unlikely for this to happen during normal use for most ear types.</p>
                            <p>Another prominent criticism was an issue that caused the charging case battery to deplete at a rapid rate despite the AirPods not being used. Users were reporting upwards of 30% idle discharge per day. In response, Apple upgraded the AirPods' firmware to version 3.5.1, which addressed connectivity and battery drain issues.</p>
                                <p>The Lithium-ion batteries in AirPods can see significant degradation over time, with two-year-old sets lasting for less than half of the advertised five hours. Apple offers "battery service" for $49 per AirPod or case, but this is actually a replacement program as batteries in AirPods cannot be removed.</p>
                <h2>Sales</h2>
                    <p>Analysts estimate Apple sold between 14 million and 16 million AirPods in 2017. In 2018 AirPods were Apple's most popular accessory product, with 35 million units sold. 15.9 million units were sold in the first half of 2019. Analysts estimate AirPods make up 60% of the global wireless headphone market. An estimated 5-7% of Apple's revenue from AirPods comes from replacement earbuds and cases.There is a way to adjust the double-tap functions of your AirPods and turn off automatic ear detection from the AirPods settings of your iPhone. When you go to the Settings app > Bluetooth > blue “i” icon next to AirPods under “My Devices,” there is a section called “Double-Tap On AirPod.” From that section, there is a way to adjust the double-tap functions of the left AirPod and the right AirPod. You can switch the double-tap function to activate Siri (“Siri”), play/pause the audio (“Play/Pause”), switch to the next track (“Next Track”), switch to the previous track (“Previous Track”) or deactivate the double-tap feature (“Off”).</p>
                        <p>The small and flush button on the back of the charging case is used for pairing the AirPods to non-Apple devices as well. To connect the AirPods to a device that you have not paired it with before, put the wireless earbuds back in the case and keep the lid of it open. Then flip the lid open and push down on the button on the case until the LED starts blinking white. From there, the AirPods should appear in the Bluetooth settings of the device you are trying to pair it with. The AirPods will not support features like automatic disconnection after taking out the headphones or double tapping if it is paired with a non-Apple device though.Your AirPods are linked to your iCloud account, so once you pair them with one device, your other devices know they exist. You can switch connections between your devices through the standard Bluetooth settings options, where AirPods will be listed on any device that you're signed into with your ‌iCloud‌ account.
